# runs a Buzz gateway must not get the signing key. Values are used directly, never
# scope-resolved (UnscopedSecretError under multiplex); the snapshot treats them as
# profile-scoped. Prefix-based so future BUZZ_* names need no code change.
# First-party platform credentials the agent's own platform adapters need in terminal children (e.g. the
# ``BUZZ_*`` vars for the Buzz messaging platform, which drive the platform-mandated ``buzz`` CLI:
# BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY, BUZZ_AUTH_TAG, BUZZ_RELAY_URL, and the other BUZZ_* names). These are the agent's OWN
# credentials — a Buzz community agent is expected to operate the ``buzz`` CLI — so they are carved out of
# the terminal scrub. CONTEXT-GATED: the carve-out applies ONLY when this process/session is actually
# operating as a Buzz agent — either the process is a Buzz-ACP managed agent (``BUZZ_MANAGED_AGENT`` is set,
# only by Buzz Desktop's buzz-acp harness; see #76243 / #78511) or the current session's platform is
# ``buzz`` (the gateway's ``HERMES_SESSION_PLATFORM`` ContextVar; concurrency safe under a multi-session
# host). A Telegram/CLI/cron session on a host that also runs a Buzz gateway does NOT get BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY
# in its terminal children — blanket passthrough of a signing key to every terminal child on the host would
# be wrong (maintainer triage note on #76243: don't expose the key to unrelated shell commands).
# ``_sanitize_subprocess_env`` is also consumed by search workers (e.g. the ddgs web-search subprocess), the
# computer-use driver binary, and user-script runners (bang ``!`` commands, quick commands, cron scripts,
# webhook-filter scripts), so those children receive the vars too — matching the approved background/PTY
# scope. Every other surface stays sealed — execute_code scrubbing, :func:`hermes_subprocess_env` (browser /
# TUI host / copilot-executor spawns), docker children, and ``env_passthrough`` registration (skills/config
# still cannot register these names). The GHSA-rhgp-j443-p4rf seal is preserved because no registration path
# is opened; this is a scrub-path exemption, not an allowlist addition. First-party matches use the merged
# env value directly — they are the process's own env values and are never scope-resolved (a profile secret
# scope under multiplex would otherwise raise UnscopedSecretError at passthrough-resolution call sites);
# only skill/config passthrough names resolve through the profile secret scope. The snapshot mechanism
# treats these names like profile-scoped passthrough names (see
# ``LocalEnvironment._additional_profile_scoped_passthrough_names``) so they never persist in the shared
# terminal snapshot across profiles. Contrast with CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN above, which is discarded from
# the blocklist entirely because it is NOT a Hermes credential; these ARE Hermes-managed first-party
# platform credentials, so they stay IN the blocklist for every non-terminal surface. See issue #78026 (Buzz

    ``_HERMES_PROVIDER_ENV_BLOCKLIST`` is name-based and derived from the
    provider/tool registries, but the gateway and CLI also inject secrets into
    ``os.environ`` at runtime under names no static registry knows about:

    - ``AUXILIARY_<TASK>_API_KEY`` / ``AUXILIARY_<TASK>_BASE_URL`` — per-task
      side-LLM credentials bridged from ``config.yaml[auxiliary]`` by
      ``gateway/run.py`` and ``cli.py`` (vision, web_extract, approval,
      compression, and any plugin-registered auxiliary task). These are
      separate, often higher-spend API keys plus base URLs that may point at
      private endpoints; a model-authored shell command must never see them.
    - ``GATEWAY_RELAY_*_SECRET`` / ``GATEWAY_RELAY_*_KEY`` /
      ``GATEWAY_RELAY_*_TOKEN`` — relay-auth material provisioned by the
      gateway (``GATEWAY_RELAY_SECRET``, ``GATEWAY_RELAY_DELIVERY_KEY``).
      These are Tier-1 gateway secrets, like the messaging bot tokens in
      ``_ALWAYS_STRIP_KEYS``. Non-secret ``GATEWAY_RELAY_*`` routing hints
      (``GATEWAY_RELAY_URL``, ``GATEWAY_RELAY_PLATFORMS``, …) are NOT matched
      and remain visible.
    - ``BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`` — the Bitwarden Secrets Manager bootstrap token,
      under the **exact** name configured via ``secrets.bitwarden.access_token_env``
      (default ``BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN``; may be remapped to any name, e.g.
      ``MY_BWS_TOKEN``). Hermes's own vault credential; no spawned child
      legitimately needs it. The one child that does — the ``bws`` CLI —
      receives it explicitly via ``build_subprocess_env(scrub_secrets=False)``
      in ``agent/secret_sources/bitwarden.py``, never through inheritance.
      Only the exact configured name is matched (not a ``*_ACCESS_TOKEN``
      suffix) so legitimate third-party access tokens stay
      ``env_passthrough``-registerable — see ``tools/env_passthrough.py``.

    ``code_execution_tool.py`` already catches these via substring matching on
    ``KEY`` / ``SECRET`` / ``TOKEN``; the terminal backend's narrower name-based
    blocklist did not, which is the leak this predicate closes.

    This is the single source of truth for "Hermes-internal dynamic secret"
    across every spawn path — the terminal ``_make_run_env`` /
    ``_sanitize_subprocess_env`` filters, the Docker passthrough filter, and the
    non-terminal :func:`hermes_subprocess_env` helper all call it, so the
    dynamic patterns are stripped **unconditionally** regardless of
    ``env_passthrough`` skill registration or ``inherit_credentials``. Nothing
    a model-driving CLI legitimately needs matches these patterns.
