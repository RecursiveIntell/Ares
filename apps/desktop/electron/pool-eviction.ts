// LRU cap accounting for the desktop backend pool.

// The pool holds two very different kinds of entries under one Map:
//   1. SPAWNED local profile backends — a real child process each (the thing
//      the POOL_MAX_BACKENDS cap exists to bound).
//   2. Process-less connection DESCRIPTORS — remote/cloud registry sources and
//      per-profile remote overrides (`entry.process === null`). These hold no
//      local process; their only cost is a cached descriptor.
//
// Counting both kinds against the cap meant a roster refresh across N
// registered remote connections could push the Map size over the cap and
// LRU-evict a REAL spawned backend that had merely been idle past the
// keepalive window. Cap accounting (and cap-driven eviction) therefore only
// considers entries with a live child process; descriptor entries remain
// subject to the idle reaper, just not to the process cap.
