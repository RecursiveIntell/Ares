// ── #95189 — Keepalive-fresh window must tolerate transient missed pings ──
// Symptom: gateway restarts every ~2 minutes on WSL2. Root cause: the renderer
// pings every 60s; the LRU cap declared a backend "stale" if `lastActiveAt`
// was > 90s ago — only 1.5× the ping interval. WSL2 IPC roundtrips (renderer
// → 9p → Electron main → ipcMain.handle) commonly stall several seconds; one
// delayed or missed ping pushed a live backend past the threshold and the
// cap-driven eviction killed the active profile's backend mid-session,
// forcing a restart loop that re-minted runtime ids and re-allocated pooled
// gateway secondaries ~700×/day (#95189, related #87906/#84716/#88054).
//
// These tests pin the new tolerance: the keepalive-fresh window is wide
// enough to absorb ≥1 missed ping (and the IPC stall headroom around it)
// without evicting an active backend. Truly stale backends (multiple lapses,
// minutes idle) are still evicted as before.

  // touched the moment before and would be touched again imminently.

  // idle). With the old 90s window, it was evicted; with the widened window
